give me a python code for a snake game

## 🤖 Assistant - 2025-08-21 03:59:32

Certainly! Below is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the `turtle` and `random` modules in Python. You can copy and run this code in a `.py` file. Make sure you have Python installed (no need for extra packages as `turtle` and `random` are part of the standard library).

```python
import turtle
import time
import random

delay = 0.1
score = 0
high_score = 0

# Set up the screen
wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.title("Snake Game")
wn.bgcolor("black")
wn.setup(width=600, height=600)
wn.tracer(0)  # Turns off screen updates

# Snake head
head = turtle.Turtle()
head.shape("square")
head.color("green")
head.penup()
head.goto(0,0)
head.direction = "stop"

# Food
food = turtle.Turtle()
food.shape("circle")
food.color("red")
food.penup()
food.goto(0,100)

segments = []

# Scoreboard
scoreboard = turtle.Turtle()
scoreboard.speed(0)
scoreboard.color("white")
scoreboard.penup()
scoreboard.hideturtle()
scoreboard.goto(0, 260)
scoreboard.write("Score: 0  High Score: 0", align="center", font=("Courier", 24, "normal"))

# Functions
def go_up():
    if head.direction != "down":
        head.direction = "up"
def go_down():
    if head.direction != "up":
        head.direction = "down"
def go_left():
    if head.direction != "right":
        head.direction = "left"
def go_right():
    if head.direction != "left":
        head.direction = "right"

def move():
    if head.direction == "up":
        head.sety(head.ycor() + 20)
    if head.direction == "down":
        head.sety(head.ycor() - 20)
    if head.direction == "left":
        head.setx(head.xcor() - 20)
    if head.direction == "right":
        head.setx(head.xcor() + 20)

# Keyboard bindings
wn.listen()
wn.onkey(go_up, "w")
wn.onkey(go_down, "s")
wn.onkey(go_left, "a")
wn.onkey(go_right, "d")

# Main game loop
while True:
    wn.update()

    # Border collision
    if (head.xcor()>290 or head.xcor()<-290 or 
        head.ycor()>290 or head.ycor()<-290):
        time.sleep(1)
        head.goto(0,0)
        head.direction = "stop"
        # Hide segments
        for segment in segments:
            segment.goto(1000,1000)
        segments.clear()
        score = 0
        scoreboard.clear()
        scoreboard.write(f"Score: {score}  High Score: {high_score}", 
                         align="center", font=("Courier", 24, "normal"))

    # Food collision
    if head.distance(food) < 20:
        # Move food
        x = random.randint(-14, 14)*20
        y = random.randint(-14, 14)*20
        food.goto(x, y)

        # Add new segment
        new_segment = turtle.Turtle()
        new_segment.shape("square")
        new_segment.color("grey")
        new_segment.penup()
        segments.append(new_segment)

        # Increase score
        score += 10
        if score > high_score:
            high_score = score
        scoreboard.clear()
        scoreboard.write(f"Score: {score}  High Score: {high_score}", 
                         align="center", font=("Courier", 24, "normal"))

    # Move the end segments
    for i in range(len(segments)-1, 0, -1):
        x = segments[i-1].xcor()
        y = segments[i-1].ycor()
        segments[i].goto(x, y)
    if len(segments) > 0:
        segments[0].goto(head.xcor(), head.ycor())

    move()

    # Check for head collision with the body
    for segment in segments:
        if segment.distance(head) < 20:
            time.sleep(1)
            head.goto(0,0)
            head.direction = "stop"
            for segment in segments:
                segment.goto(1000,1000)
            segments.clear()
            score = 0
            scoreboard.clear()
            scoreboard.write(f"Score: {score}  High Score: {high_score}", 
                             align="center", font=("Courier", 24, "normal"))

    time.sleep(delay)

wn.mainloop()
```

**Controls:**  
Use `WASD` keys to control the snake (W=up, S=down, A=left, D=right).

convert it in r

## 🤖 Assistant - 2025-08-21 03:59:52

Sure! Creating a real-time interactive Snake game in R is quite a bit more challenging than in Python, primarily because R is not designed for interactive graphical games like this. However, you **can** create a basic Snake game using the [`tcltk`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/tcltk/html/tcltk-package.html) package, which wraps the TCL/TK GUI toolkit. 

Below is a basic version of a Snake game in R using `tcltk`. It’s much more limited than the Python turtle version, but you can run it in any standard R installation (with `tcltk`).

```r
library(tcltk)

size <- 20
width <- 20
height <- 20
score <- 0
direction <- "Right"
stop_game <- FALSE

win <- tktoplevel()
tkwm.title(win, "Snake Game in R")
canvas <- tkcanvas(win, width=(width*size), height=(height*size), bg="black")
tkpack(canvas)

snake <- list(c(5, 10), c(4, 10), c(3, 10))
apple <- c(sample(1:width, 1), sample(1:height, 1))

draw_snake <- function() {
  tkdelete(canvas, "all")
  # Draw apple
  x <- apple[1] * size
  y <- apple[2] * size
  tkcreate(canvas, "oval", x, y, x + size, y + size, fill='red', outline='red')
  # Draw snake
  for (seg in snake) {
    x <- seg[1] * size
    y <- seg[2] * size
    tkcreate(canvas, "rectangle", x, y, x + size, y + size, fill='green', outline='white')
  }
}

move_snake <- function() {
  if (stop_game) return()
  head <- snake[[1]]
  if (direction == "Left") new_head <- c(head[1] - 1, head[2])
  if (direction == "Right") new_head <- c(head[1] + 1, head[2])
  if (direction == "Up") new_head <- c(head[1], head[2] - 1)
  if (direction == "Down") new_head <- c(head[1], head[2] + 1)

  # Check walls
  if (new_head[1] < 0 || new_head[2] < 0 || new_head[1] >= width || new_head[2] >= height ||
      any(sapply(snake, function(seg) all(seg==new_head)))) {
    tkmessageBox(message="Game Over!")
    stop_game <<- TRUE
    return()
  }
  snake <<- append(list(new_head), snake)
  # Check apple
  if (all(new_head == apple)) {
    apple <<- c(sample(1:width, 1), sample(1:height, 1))
    score <<- score + 1
  } else {
    snake <<- snake[1:(length(snake)-1)]
  }
  draw_snake()
  tcl("after", 100, move_snake)
}

up <- function() { if (direction != "Down") direction <<- "Up" }
down <- function() { if (direction != "Up") direction <<- "Down" }
left <- function() { if (direction != "Right") direction <<- "Left" }
right <- function() { if (direction != "Left") direction <<- "Right" }

tkbind(win, "<Up>", function() up())
tkbind(win, "<Down>", function() down())
tkbind(win, "<Left>", function() left())
tkbind(win, "<Right>", function() right())

draw_snake()
tcl("after", 100, move_snake)

tkfocus(win)
```

**How to play:**
- Copy and paste the code into your R console.
- Use your keyboard's **arrow keys** to control the snake.
- A message box will pop up when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

---

**Limitations:**  
- R’s GUI (tcltk) is quite basic and may not be as fast or smooth as Python’s turtle module.
- There’s no scoreboard display, but you can see your `score` variable in the R console after the game ends.
